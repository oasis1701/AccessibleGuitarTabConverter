# Generate package-lock.json

To properly create the lock file, run this command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Create a proper `package-lock.json` file with exact versions
3. You can then commit this file to git

After running `npm install`, commit the generated `package-lock.json`:

```bash
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add package-lock.json"
git push
```

This lock file ensures everyone gets the exact same dependency versions.
